<Prose>

I was born in 2002.

I am involved in web development since I was a high school student.
After graduating high school, I have been in charge of software designing and implementing in both fields of front-end and back-end engineering.
I'm a training instructor as well as being a leading developer.
I headed the study group in my previous company for HTML, CSS, VBA, and so on Laravel.

I joined [PixelGrid Inc](https://www.pxgrid.com/) in November 2022.
I have been working as the youngest front-end developer of PixelGrid Inc.

### April 2022

#### led an e-commerce website project at an IT company in Tokyo

In terms of implementations, I was in charge of both fields of front-end and back-end engineering. For instance, I worked on building the screen and implementation of the form validation using Vue. Moreover, I implemented the chat and authentication function using Laravel.
There were many project members who had no experience in using web frameworks. As the tech leader, I gave them technical guidance. Eventually, they learned to develop by themself.

### January 2021

#### began to study programming

First, I started to study expl3 which is a core language of next generation LaTeX. However, it is too hard for me.
Therefore, I started to study more commonly known languages, such as C and Python, because there are many learning materials for them.

### June 2020

#### began typesetting and macro development by LaTeX

I wanted to make high quality textbooks. In order to do that, I started to study typesetting with LaTeX.
Since then, I've been also interested macro development by LaTeX.
This led to my curiosity in programming.

### March 2020

#### my own educational materials was released on Clearnote

I'm interested in college-level mathematics, physics, and organic chemistry.
I wrote textbooks for my learning purposes and it received good reviews from university students.
As a result, I was scouted as an educational writer by [Clearnote](https://www.clearnotebooks.com/ja/authors/2541851).
