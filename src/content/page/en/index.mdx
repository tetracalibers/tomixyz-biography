I have been involved in web development since I was a high school student.
After graduating from high school, I have been responsible for designing and implementing software in front-end and back-end engineering fields.
I'm a training instructor as well as a leading developer.
I led the study group in my previous company for HTML, CSS, VBA, and Laravel.

I joined [PixelGrid Inc.](https://www.pxgrid.com/) in November 2022.

## History

### November 2022

#### I joined PixelGrid Inc.

I made a 5-minute presentation under the theme of “Intuitive Pagination API” in the job interview.

### May 2022

#### I organized the study group for HTML, CSS, VBA, etc.

I organized the study group on Zoom. There were 10 to 20 participants.
I gave a lecture with a focus on demonstration based on the teaching materials that I made beforehand.

### April 2022

#### I led an e-commerce website project at an IT company in Tokyo.

I was in charge of the database design, API design, and screen layout.
In terms of implementations, I was in charge of both fields of front-end and back-end engineering. For instance, I worked on building the screen and implementation of the form validation using Vue. Moreover, I implemented the chat and authentication function using Laravel.
Many project members needed to gain experience in using web frameworks. As the tech leader, I gave them technical guidance. Eventually, they learned to develop by themself.

### March 2022

#### I graduated from high school.

After graduating from high school, I moved to Tokyo.

### May 2021

#### I got my first job offer as a freelance web developer.

I made a CMS and BBS for my new client through my business activities on Twitter.

### March 2021

#### I began to study web technologies.

I started to study HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. At the same time, I began to learn Bash to automate the build of a development environment.

### January 2021

#### I began to study programming.

First, I started to study expl3, which is a core language of next-generation LaTeX. However, it is too hard for me.
Therefore, I started to study more commonly known languages, such as C and Python, because there are many learning materials for them.

### June 2020

#### I began typesetting and macro development with LaTeX.

I wanted to make high-quality textbooks. To do that, I started to study typesetting with LaTeX.
Since then, I've also been interested in macro development by LaTeX.
It led to my curiosity in programming.

### March 2020

#### My educational materials were released on Clearnote.

I'm interested in college-level mathematics, physics, and organic chemistry.
I wrote textbooks for my learning purposes, which received good reviews from university students.
As a result, I was scouted as an educational writer by Clearnote.
